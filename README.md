## Description: 

         In this project we used HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, NodeJS, express.js to create a Note Taker app that allows you to create and delete simple notes

## Installation:

         Follow the link below to use this. No installation needed.

## Usage:

         Upon opening the link simply hit the "Get Started" button. This will take you to the note taker page which has a Note Title and Note Text area where you can fill out your notes. When you begin to type in the text area a save button will appear that looks like a floppy disk. WHen you are done you can save your note with this button and if you have notes aready saved they will appear on the left side. These notes will also have a trash can button which you can use for deletion.
